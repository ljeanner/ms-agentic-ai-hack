Description of Incident:
On July 18, 2025, at approximately 4:10 PM, I was driving eastbound on Madison Avenue in Albany, New York. While proceeding through a green light at the intersection with Parkwood Street, another vehicle traveling southbound failed to stop at a red signal and struck my vehicle hard on the driver’s side. My car spun partially as a result of the impact before coming to a stop near the curb.

The force of the collision crumpled both the driver’s door and rear door, bent the frame at the center pillar, and damaged the rear wheel. The doors can no longer open normally and the rear window on the driver’s side shattered. Airbags deployed on the impacted side of the vehicle. Emergency services responded to the scene; the other driver admitted fault to the police and their details were recorded.

Description of Damages:

Heavy intrusion and bending on the driver’s front and rear doors

B-pillar area severely compromised

Rear wheel misaligned, not functional for safe driving

Shattered rear driver’s side window

Scraping and paint transfer along both driver’s side doors and lower panels
